## Priority Recommendations

### ✅ COMPLETED SINCE LAST UPDATE
1. ~~Implement SketchRenderer~~ → **DONE** (1955 LOC production)
2. ~~Create MakeFace wrapper~~ → **DONE** (FaceBuilder 719 LOC)
3. ~~Add Rectangle/Ellipse tools~~ → **DONE** (all 7 tools complete)
4. ~~Implement SnapManager~~ → **DONE** (1166 LOC, 8 snap types)

### Immediate Next Steps (High Priority for Phase 3)
1. **Fix Grid3D adaptive spacing** — Refactor from fixed 10mm to spec-compliant adaptive tiers (SPEC DEVIATION).
2. **Integrate ElementMap into Document** — Wire topological naming into feature tree (blocking Phase 3).
3. **Implement Extrude operation** — First 3D modeling primitive (requires ElementMap integration).
4. **Create Feature History infrastructure** — Parametric operation replay (blocking extrude parametric mode).

### Short-term (Medium Priority - UX Polish)
5. Add Camera inertia physics and sticky pivot (270 LOC existing base).
6. Complete DOF color-coding UI wiring (logic exists in SketchRenderer).
7. Wire PropertyInspector into UI (88 LOC stub exists, not integrated).
8. Implement Selection Manager ray-casting for 3D entities (sketch selection exists).

### Blocking Items for Phase 3
- ✅ ~~MakeFace wrapper~~ → COMPLETE
- ✅ ~~SketchRenderer~~ → COMPLETE
- ⚠️ **ElementMap Document integration** → NOT WIRED (kernel component ready, needs feature tree)
- ⚠️ **Grid3D adaptive spacing** → SPEC DEVIATION (claims adaptive, implements fixed)

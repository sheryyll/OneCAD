## Phase 1: Core Foundation & Topological Infrastructure

## Priority Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps (High Priority)
1. **Complete Loop Detection** (Phase 2.4) — Critical for sketch→3D workflow.
2. **Implement SketchRenderer** — Visual feedback for sketch editing.
3. **Add Rectangle/Ellipse tools** — Complete primitive set.

### Short-term (Medium Priority)
4. Finish Camera inertia physics and sticky pivot.
5. Implement Selection Manager with ray-casting.
6. Add 30 FPS throttling to interactive solver.

### Blocking Items for Phase 3
- Loop Detection must work before Extrude can be implemented.
- Face creation (MakeFace) must work before any sketch→solid operations.
